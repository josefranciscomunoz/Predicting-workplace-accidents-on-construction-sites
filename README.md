# Predicting workplace accidents on construction sites

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The construction sector shows high occupational accident figures. When an accident occurs on a construction site, corrective measures are usually implemented in order
to prevent the same type of accident from happening again, but it is no longer possible to prevent the accident in the past. AI can predict these accidents 
and thus contribute to improving the level of health and safety and reducing occupational accidents on construction sites.

## Background

The PhD thesis entitled "Design and validation of a predictive tool for occupational accidents on construction sites" (Universidad de Zaragoza, ISSN 2254-7606 nÂº2018-110)
uses logistic regression and regression trees, resulting in a simple model with a high predictive capacity.

Nevertheless, construction sites can be of different types and sizes, so by introducing neural networks, the model and, therefore, the learning process 
can be greatly improved in order to increase the predictive capacity of the tool.

## How is it used?

Between 2006 and 2008 I reviewed 242 construction sites in Spain with the help of a well-researched check-list. These construction sites presents accidents 
that have occurred (lagging indicators) and practical, organisational and documentary characteristics (leading indicators). By contrasting certain leading indicators 
with lagging indicators, allows the predictive evaluation of the possibility of occurrence of work accidents in the construction sites. 

Applying logistic regression, a predictive model was established and validated with another 72 construction sites in 2012. 

So far, it has proven to be an adequate predictive tool, with 85.0% predictive ability for minor accidents and 82.8% for major accidents. 

With the help of AI, predictive capacity can be improved.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data source: New round of works review based on improved check-list to get inputs (based on leading and lagging indicators), in order to improve the model.

AI Methods: logistic regression, neural networks, deep learning.

## Challenges

Involve construction companies or public institutions related to the construction sector.

Learning programming (Python and/or others).

Getting collaboration to programme an app

## What next?

The next steps are to improve the model, to make the model learn from itself, and to implement it in a user-friendly software tool (app or similar).
